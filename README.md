# Reinforcement Learning Algorithm With PyTorch


### Basic Algorithm
- DQN
- REINFORCE
- Actor-Critic
- Asynchronous Actor-Critic(to work)


### Paper Algorithm
- ICM(Intrinsic Curiosity Model) (to work)
- RND(Random Network Distillation) (to work)
- FuN() (to work)

### Research

##### TE-DQN (terminal estimation)
Have better performance in Actor-Critic method, If the termination state is not handled correctly, it can lead to serious policy degradation.

##### MH-DQN (multi head estimation)
Having a similar learning machism like bagging
