# Reinforcement Learning Algorithm With PyTorch

## In Process
can't directly use now.

### How to Use
requirement:
 - torch
 - gym
 - atari_py

### Basic Algorithm
- DQN
- REINFORCE
- Advantage Actor-Critic
- DDPG

### Paper Algorithm
- ICM(Intrinsic Curiosity Model) (to work)
- RND(Random Network Distillation) (to work)
- FuN() (to work)
- APE-X(CPU version)

### Research

##### TE-DQN (terminal estimation)
Have better performance in Actor-Critic method. See relative file to learn more.

##### MH-DQN (multi head estimation)
Having a similar learning machism like bagging

#### Record
