# Reinforcement Learning Algorithm With PyTorch


### Basic Algorithm
- DQN
- REINFORCE
- Actor-Critic
- A3C(to work)


### Paper Algorithm
- ICM(Intrinsic Curiosity Model) (to work)
- RND(Random Network Distillation) (to work)
- FuN() (to work)

### improvement trick
- DB-DQN: Have better performance in Actor-Critic method

### Knowledge
